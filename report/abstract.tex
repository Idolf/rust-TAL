  Typed Assembly Language (TAL) is an interesting technique, as it allows safe
  distribution and execution of untrusted code, without resorting to a trusted
  third-party. In this thesis we give a thorough introduction to TAL including
  how it is built ``on top'' of a real-world language. After this general
  introduction, we narrow our focus and look at the specific details of the TAL
  defined in \cite{STAL}.

  Our contributions in this thesis is two-fold:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We formalize and prove theorems asserted in \cite{STAL}. The bulk of
    this work takes the form of an implementation in Agda, while the report
    itself is mostly concerned with the formalizations and the structure of the
    proof.
  \item While creating the Agda-code several challenges were encountered and
    overcome. This gave rise to a number of smaller, but nonetheless interesting
    techniques that could likely be relevant outside Typed Assembly
    Language. These ``lessons learned'' have been included in a chapter meant to
    be readable independently of the rest of the report.
  \end{itemize}
