\section{Miscellaneous small lemmas}

There are more small lemmas in the Agda file \texttt{Misc.agda}. I have only
included those that are not deemed trivial.

\begin{lemma}
  If we have $\substitution{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$ and
  $\substitution{\Delta_2}{c}{\Delta_2'}$, then we also have
  $\substitution{(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)}{c}{(\Delta_1',\Delta_2')}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction over the derivation of $\substitution{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  If we have $\substitution{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$ and
  $\run{\Delta_2}{c}{\Delta_2'}$, then we also have
  $\run{(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)}{c}{(\Delta_1',\Delta_2')}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction over the derivation of $\substitution{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  If we have $\run{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$, then we also have
  $\run{(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)}{c}{(\Delta_1',\Delta_2)}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction over the derivation of $\run{\Delta_1}{c}{\Delta_1'}$.
\end{proof}
