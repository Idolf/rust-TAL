\subsection{Comments}
In the previous, $regs$ is a constant. Its value of the number of registers on
the machine in question. The concrete value of $regs$ does not matter for any of
the proofs, but in my code, I set the value to $4$.

The references $\alpha$ and $\rho$ are implemented using De Bruijn indexes. This
is relevant both in $types$, $stack\ types$ and in $casts$, where they are
used. It is also relevant in the $\mathtt{weaken}$ case of $casts$, as we need
to know \emph{where} to weaken.

Note also that for technical reasons, a lot of the constructors in Agda does not
actually look like this. For instance we use $\iota \sim> I$ instead of
$\iota ; I$ and $v \llbracket c \rrbracket$ instead of $v [ c ]$. We also use
$\mathtt{sld}\ r_d, i$ and $\mathtt{sst}\ i, r_s$ instead of
$\mathtt{ld}\ r_d, \mathtt{sp}, i$ and $\mathtt{st}\ \mathtt{sp}, i, r_s$.

Note also that in the Agda-code, the $\mathtt{globval}\ l_{g,k}$ of $w$ also
includes the number of assumptions used in the corresponding code global. This
would ideally be removed later.

\subsection{Differences from STAL}

\begin{itemize}
\item No existential types
\item No stack-pointer types
\item No compound stacks
\item The original paper has an unlimited number of registers, with only a
  finite amount used at any time. We have a fixed number.
\item The heap has been split up into the \texttt{Globals}, containing immutable
  code and, and \texttt{Heap} containing only mutable tuples.
\item The instructions are slightly different -- for instance there is no \texttt{salloc}/\texttt{sfree}, only \texttt{push}/\texttt{pop}.
\item The small step semanics will not update the globals.
\end{itemize}
