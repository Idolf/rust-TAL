\begin{frame}{Conclusion -- my results}
  \begin{itemize}
  \pause\item Encoded \ATAL and \ATALe in Agda.
  \pause\item Defined what is meant by safety in those two languages.
  \pause\item Implemented erasure from \ATAL to \ATALe.
  \pause\item Shown that erasure preserves safety.
  \pause\item Implemented a type-checker.
  \pause\item Shown that, if the type-checker accepts a program, then that
  program is safe.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion -- what remains}
  If you wish to further remove the assembler from the TCB, then the following
  is also needed:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement the assembler from \ATALe to native.
  \item Define safety in the native context.
  \item Show that the assembler preserves safety.
  \end{itemize}

  \pause The last two are somewhere between complicated and impossible depending
  on your philosophical point of view.
