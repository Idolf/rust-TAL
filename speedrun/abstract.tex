  Typed Assembly Language (TAL) is an interesting technique, as it allows
  provably safe distribution and execution of untrusted code, without assuming
  the presence of a trusted third-party. In this thesis we give a thorough
  introduction to TAL including how it is built ``on top'' of a real-world
  language. We then formalize a version of TAL that is mostly compatible with
  the one presented in the paper ``Stack-Based Typed Assembly Language''.

  Our contributions in this thesis is two-fold:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We formalize the metatheory of our language. Specifically we prove
    soundness, decidable type-checking and a erasure theorem using Agda.
  \item While creating the Agda-code several challenges were encountered and
    overcome. This gave rise to a number of smaller, but nonetheless interesting
    techniques that could likely be relevant outside Typed Assembly
    Language. These ``lessons learned'' have been included in a chapter meant to
    be readable independently of the rest of the report.
  \end{itemize}
