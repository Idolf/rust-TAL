\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this thesis I have presented my Typed Assembly Language called \ATAL along
with the type-erased version \ATALe. \ATAL is largely inspired by the language
STAL defined in ``Stack-based Typed Assembly Language''\cite{STAL} by Morrisett
et al., though I have made a number of small improvements.

I have formalized the meta-theory of the presented languages in
Agda. Specifically my Agda code contains these parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item I formalized a small-step relation for each language and proved that the
  relation is deterministic.
\item I proved that the two semantics are related by the erasure property.
\item I introduced a type system for \ATAL and proved soundness for the system.
\item I proved that the type system is decidable. Specifically this was done by
  implementing a provably correct type-checker.
\end{itemize}

Additionally I have argued, why I believe this formalization is useful. In
particular I have argued:

\begin{itemize}
\item How machine-verifiable proofs of soundness reduce the TCB.
\item Why an Agda-implementation is an interesting contribution.
\item How one can build on top of this Agda implementation.
\end{itemize}

Finally I presented several observations and lessons learned about doing a
project of this size in particular as a programmer new to the language Agda.
