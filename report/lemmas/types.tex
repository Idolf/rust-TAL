\section{Typing Lemmas}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $T \in \mathbb{C}$, $v \in T$ and assume we have some $\Delta$. We will
  now show these two statements:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume $T \in \mathbb{V}_\Delta$. It is then decidable if there exists a
    derivation of $\valid{\Delta}{v}$.
  \item Assume $T \in \mathbb{V}$. It is then decidable if there exists a
    derivation of $\valid{}{v}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\label{dec:type}
\begin{proof}
  We prove both statements together using induction over $v$. There are only two
  non-trivial cases:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $T = types$. Do we then have a derivation of
    $\valid{\Delta}{\alpha}$?  There is obviously only one such derivation,
    which depends on whether $\alpha \in \Delta$. Since this is decidable, the
    original question is too.
  \item Let $T = stack\ types$. Do we then have a derivation of
    $\valid{\Delta}{\rho}$? However this questions is analogous to the previous
    one.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $T \in \mathbb{V}_\Delta$, let $v \in T$ and assume we get a derivation of
  $\valid{\Delta}{v}$. We can now construct a derivation of
  $\valid{\Delta,\Delta'}{v}$ for any $\Delta'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction over the structure of $\valid{\Delta}{v}$.
\end{proof}
